### Overview

This is a demo of normalizing data using Power Query in Excel or PowerBI to create Fact and Dimension tables.

### Benefits of Data Normalization

- Consistency: It ensures that the same data standards are applied across different datasets.
- Error Reduction: Minimizes the likelihood of errors that can arise from dealing with data
- Improve Analysis Quality: Yield more accurate results as the scale of the input data does not skew them.

### Data Source

Sales Data: The primary dataset used for this exercise is the "sales_transaction.xlsx" file, containing detailed information about each sale made by the company.

### Tools

- Excel: For the data source
- Power Query: For the data cleaning and transformation.

### Data Cleaning and Transformation

In the data preparation phase, we will perform the following tasks:

1. Data loading and inspection.
2. Setting up data in a tabular format.
3. Organize the dataset with Rows representing records and Columns representing variables.
4. Check and correct data types.
